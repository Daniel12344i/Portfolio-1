Portfolio- v2
Project Overview

This version builds upon the initial portfolio project by:

    Converting the frontend to React for a better development experience and dynamic updates.
    Setting up a Node.js backend using the Hono framework.
    Integrating backend API endpoints to fetch, add, update, and delete project data stored in a JSON file.
    Utilizing TypeScript for enhanced type safety on both frontend and backend.
    CORS configuration to ensure communication between the frontend and backend.

Features

    Frontend built with React:
        Dynamically displays a list of projects.
        Forms to add and update projects.
        Option to delete projects.

    Backend with Hono and Node.js:
        Provides API endpoints to handle:
            GET: Fetch all projects.
            POST: Add a new project.
            POST (update): Update an existing project.
            POST (delete): Remove a project.

    Data Persistence:
        The project data is saved and loaded from a JSON file on the backend (projects.json).



The design of the application is based on the following layout:

Project Structure
Frontend

    React handles the UI components and dynamic rendering.
    TypeScript ensures type safety and better development practices.
    Vite is used as the build tool for fast and optimized bundling.

Backend

    Node.js runs the backend server.
    Hono is used to manage routing and handle API requests.
    TypeScript is also used in the backend to maintain consistency and type safety.
